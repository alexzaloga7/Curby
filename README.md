# Project Name

CURBY

# What is Curby?

Curby allows users to share details of free items they spot in their neighborhood. Everyday items are left on the curb/stoop so they can be collected by garbage disposal and taken to landfill. Many of these items are in great shape & free which could be rehomed and given a new lease of life.

# How does it work?

The app works by allowing users to review the listings page which provides details and displays nearby items that are free to take. While those disposing of items can upload them to the platform as an extra measure before they go to a landfill, Curby's primary support comes from the general public themselves, the community that gets a thrill out of finding treasures around town and promoting sustainability by helping others.

# Whats the problem Curby is trying to solve?

The Canadian landfill sites are filled with millions of tonnes of furniture, appliances, and other durable goods each year. Also with the increasing costs of essential goods and services outpacing income growth for many Canadians, Curby offers an affordable way to furnish homes and collect items for free.
Curby also promotes community engagement by encouraging people to explore their neighborhoods and share exciting finds with others. This creates a sense of shared responsibility for waste reduction and helps keep items out of landfills.
